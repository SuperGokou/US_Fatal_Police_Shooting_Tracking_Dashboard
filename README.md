## Background and Motivation

### Background
Police brutality has become a focal point of discussion, particularly in the wake of George Floyd's death in 2020. This project aims to analyze and interpret the prevalence of police brutality in the United States, identifying the demographics most impacted compared to other countries.

### Motivation
The goal of this project is to present a clear, statistical view of the police brutality epidemic in the United States, contributing factual clarity to a deeply emotional discourse. By providing incontrovertible statistics, we hope to outline the severity of the issue comprehensively.

## Related Work
While our project is driven by a personal passion for addressing issues of police brutality and does not stem from external projects, we are inspired by impactful data visualizations such as the portrayal of lives lost in the Middle East. The use of a bar graph with an artistic touch—such as “blood” dripping down—greatly emphasizes the emotional weight of the data, a technique we aspire to emulate in our visualizations.

## Project Plan

### Data Collection
- Gathering data on incidents of police use of force across various states.
- Collecting demographic data of affected populations.

### Data Analysis
- Statistical analysis to identify trends and patterns.
- Comparative analysis to understand the scale of the issue in the U.S. versus other countries.

### Visualization
- Development of compelling visual representations of the data to convey the emotional and factual narrative effectively.

### Review and Refinement
- Iterative reviews to refine analyses and visualizations based on feedback.

## Future Goals
- To expand the dataset to include more granular geographic details.
- To enhance the interactivity of the visualizations for broader public engagement.
